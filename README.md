# Yelp Collections Clone
A project created using a Node.js backend (server for API, proxy, routing, and MongoDB Cloud interactions) with a REACT frontend. <br />
<br/>
The purpose was to learn the MERN stack by creating a rendition of Yelp Collections - an application that allows you to save groups of business pages for future reference. This application does something similar - saving custom groups of restaurants, bars, dessert places, museums, and any other sorts of collections of places for reference and sharing.
<br />

## Deployment
The application is deployed via Heroku here: https://gentle-tundra-70710.herokuapp.com/
